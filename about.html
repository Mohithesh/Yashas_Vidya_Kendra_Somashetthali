			<p>Dear Parents,</p>

            <p>Over the last decade or so the world has seen a tremendous change, growth and use of technology in every field. Similarly Education has also undergone a rapid change in the process. Technology has given wide and huge dimensions to enhance the teaching-learning Processes. The journey from the ancient Gurukula system to the modern day class-Rooms is worth rewinding. Value based education coupled with the Academic Excellence in children has now become the mantra in education. Every person now wants to learn as many skills as possible in the shortest time. That means at school we have to work with children in such a way so as to develop positive skills which will enable them to learn the maximum skills.</p>
			
			<p>The Yashas Institutions stands out uniquely among all other schools where every child is viewed as an individual with unique potential and opportunities are provided at
				every stage in school for the child to discover his/her potential. The struggles and strives of the modern world and its uncertainties makes it imperative that
				education not only ennobles them and makes them good citizens of tomorrow, it also makes them men of character, value and tradition. Education breeds confidence,
				Confidence breeds hope and hope breeds peace. Schooling must be a wonderful experience and the school must provide a platform for it. I would like to focus on the
				USP of our school. ‘Care and Nurture’ caring for every individual 
				and nurturing the innate potential of every child. Let us join hands in making education the most powerful weapon we can use to 
				change the world for a better tomorrow.</p>

			<p>Yashas Vidya Kendra, is an institution that focuses on excellence in scholastic and Co-Scholastics aspects of the child’s personality. Academics has been and will continue to be our first priority. We are very fortunate to have an outstanding faculty and support staff, who work diligently to realize the vision of all round excellence.</p>

            <p>Our motto, “Learn, Achieve and Inspire” captures the essence of our spirit. In our school, children gain an all-round education and achieve their potential not just in the academic field but also in the field of sports and creative arts.</p>
			
			<p>Each child is different. We, as educators offer and provide opportunities to each of the individual to bring out the best in them. It is said that a leader is born with the birth of every child. The need is to provide an enabling environment and careful nurturing to the diverse talented children under our care.</p>
			
			<p>I believe that a good school celebrates its past, enjoys its present and imagines its future. But a great school challenges the students to be actively involved in all these things for themselves; this is what we do at Yashas Institutions.</p>

				<p>Yashas institutions believe in a culture of excellence in all aspects of education. True education is training of both the head and the heart. So we strive to prepare students not only for examination but for life, without losing their areas of specialization and competence.</p>

				<p>Our students are encouraged to participate to the fullest possible extent in the social, physical and cultural activities of the school, so that on completion of their formal education they may emerge as self disciplined, responsible and well adjusted citizens, capable of playing an active and positive role in modern society.</p>
				
				<p>Parents are encouraged to maintain close contact with the school. There is a need to work closely so that home/school can have a shared sense of purpose and mutual respect with the sharing of information, responsibility and skills.</p>
				
				<p>The students are provides liberality to express their views and suggestions and are provided with the aspects of positive traits in life.</p>
				
				<p>We are sure about goal as well as the means to reach it. We believe perseverance is the only secret of success with the unclenching support of the parents. I am sure, the journey on the path of progress would be smooth  & smiling.</p>
